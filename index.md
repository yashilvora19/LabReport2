# Lab Report 2

This lab report contains content learnt in the 15L lab of weeks 2 and 3. There are 3 parts within this report:
- Part 1: Creating a Webserver
- Part 2: Analyzing a Bug from Lab 3
- Part 3: Reflection of Learnings from Labs

## Part 1: Creating a Webserver



## Part 2: Analyzing a Bug from Lab 3



## Part 3: Reflection of Learnings from Labs

This is the final part of my lab report. I learnt a lot in the past 2 weeks and the lab sessions were extremely valuable to me to facilitate my progress in building my knowledge and learning new things. In my week 2 lab session, I learned more about the ```URLHandler``` interface, building and running a web server both locally and remotely, and got a better understanding about how a web server works and how to program it. In my week 3 lab session, I worked on fixing bugs in various files using Junit tests, understood what symptoms and failure inducing outputs are, and worked with arrays, lists, and linked lists.

Both these sessions pushed me to explore new concepts and helped me learn new things I didn't know before!
